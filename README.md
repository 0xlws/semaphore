# Semaphore

Join the [Telegram group](https://t.me/joinchat/B-PQx1U3GtAh--Z4Fwo56A) to discuss.

## Introduction

Semaphore is a zero-knowledge gadget which allows users to prove their
membership of a set without revealing their original identity. At the same
time, it allows users to signal their endorsement of an arbitrary string. It is
designed to be a simple and generic privacy layer for Ethereum dApps. Use cases
include private voting, whistleblowing, mixers, and anonymous authentication.

<!-- TODO: update with a gh-pages link -->
For more information, refer to the [documentation](./docs_src/about.md).

### Semaphore functions

#### `insertIdentity(uint256 _identityCommitment)`

This inserts the user's identity commitment into the Semaphore contract's
Merkle tree of identities.

The client should generate it using
[`libsemaphore`](https://github.com/weijiekoh/libsemaphore)'s
`genIdentityCommitment()` function.

#### `broadcastSignal(...)`

TODO: fix this

The full function signature is:

```
broadcastSignal(
    bytes memory _signal,
    uint256[8] memory _proof,
    uint256 _root,
    uint256 _nullifiersHash,
    uint232 _externalNullifier
)
```

<!--TODO: refactor libsemaphore to be friendly to the new signature of-->
<!--broadcastSignal and rewrite the following explanation-->
<!--Basically, it would be useful to have a helper function that abstracts over
the production of these values-->

- `_signal`: The signal to broadcast. Use `ethers.utils.toUtf8Bytes(SIGNAL)` to
  generate it, where `SIGNAL` is a string.

- `_proof`: The zk-SNARK proof generated by `libsemaphore`'s
  `genBroadcastSignalParams()` function.

- `_root`: The root of the Merkle tree. This is part of the output of
  `libsemaphore`'s `genWitness()` function.

- `_nullifiersHash`: A uniquely derived hash of the external nullifier, user's
  identity nullifier, and the Merkle path index to their identity commitment.
  It ensures that a user cannot broadcast a signal with the same external
  nullifier more than once.

- `_externalNullifier`: A 29-byte value which serves as a context of sorts for
  the signal. Refer to the [high-level explanation of
  Semaphore](https://medium.com/coinmonks/to-mixers-and-beyond-presenting-semaphore-a-privacy-gadget-built-on-ethereum-4c8b00857c9b)
  for more details.

4. (Optional) Has functions which call the Semaphore contract's:

    - `addExternalNullifier()`

    - `deactivateExternalNullifier()`

    - `reactivateExternalNullifier()`

These functions add, deactivate, and reactivate an external nullifier respectively.
As each identity can only signal once to an external nullifier, and as a signal
can only be successfully broadcasted to an active external nullifier, these
functions enable use cases where it is necessary to have multiple external
nullifiers or to activate and/or deactivate them.

5. (Optional) There is also a function which controls broadcast permissioning:
   `setPermissioning(bool _newPermission)`. If permissioning is set to `true`,
   then only the owner (usually the Client contract) may call
   `broadcastSignal()`. Otherwise, anyone may do so.

## Audit results

The [Ethereum Foundation](https://ethereum.org/) and [POA
Network](https://www.poa.network/) commissioned [ABDK
Consulting](https://www.abdk.consulting) to audit the source code of Semaphore
as well as [circomlib](https://github.com/iden3/circomlib), which contains
components which the Semaphore zk-SNARK uses.

The results of the audit can be found in the [audit/](./audit) directory. The
team's responses to their results can be found in
[audit/README.md](./audit/README.md).

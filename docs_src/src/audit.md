# Security audit

The [Ethereum Foundation](https://ethereum.org/) and [POA
Network](https://www.poa.network/) commissioned [ABDK
Consulting](https://www.abdk.consulting) to audit the source code of Semaphore
as well as relevant circuits in
[circomlib](https://github.com/iden3/circomlib), which contains components
which the Semaphore zk-SNARK uses.

All security and performance issues have been fixed. The full audit report will
be available soon.
